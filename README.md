**PRBench** is the first *comprehensive* benchmark for evaluating largeâ€‘languageâ€‘model (LLM) **scientificâ€‘paper reading assistants**.  
It contains **1â€¯865 expertâ€‘annotated samples**, grouped into **three core tasks** and **twelve subâ€‘tasks**, each designed to test a distinct capability required in realistic paperâ€‘reading scenariosÂ :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

| Task | Purpose | Example Skills Tested |
|------|---------|-----------------------|
| **Aspectâ€‘basedâ€¯Summarization (AS)** | Fineâ€‘grained factual extraction from full papers | Identify motivation, methods, results, etc. :contentReference |
| **Multiâ€‘Turnâ€¯Conversation (MT)** | Maintain coherent dialogue across turns | Progressive conceptual understanding, contextual exploration, depth of inquiry  |
| **Externalâ€¯Informationâ€¯Comprehension (EIC)** | Incorporate knowledge beyond the paper | Crossâ€‘article reasoning, domain knowledge, retrievalâ€‘augmented QA  |

Evaluation relies on **RLScore**, a rubricâ€‘based *LLMâ€‘asâ€‘aâ€‘Judge* metric that outperforms traditional surface metrics such as ROUGEâ€‘L and BERTScore in correlating with human judgment.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights
* **Fullâ€‘text** coverage &nbsp;â€” every sample draws on complete papers instead of abstracts.  
* **Multiple documents + tasks + rubrics** â€” PRBench uniquely evaluates multiâ€‘document reasoning, multiâ€‘turn dialogue, and rubricâ€‘driven scoringÂ :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.  
* **Industryâ€‘scale baseline results** for openâ€‘weight, closedâ€‘weight, and proprietary assistants (GPTâ€‘4o, GeminiÂ 1.5/2.0, Qwenâ€‘Long, etc.).  
* **Plugâ€‘andâ€‘play scripts** for dataset download, preprocessing, model inference, and metric calculation.
