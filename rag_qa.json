        "question": "What are some limitations of the Flamingo model?",
        "answer": "Flamingo shares common issues with large language models, such as hallucinations, outputting offensive language, and propagating social biases. Additionally, its ability to handle visual inputs introduces specific risks, including gender and racial biases related to the content of input images.",
