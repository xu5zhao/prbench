        "question": "What are some limitations of the Flamingo model?",
        "answer": "Flamingo shares common issues with large language models, such as hallucinations, outputting offensive language, and propagating social biases. Additionally, its ability to handle visual inputs introduces specific risks, including gender and racial biases related to the content of input images.",

        "question": "How does Flamingo handle sequences of interleaved visual and textual data?",
        "answer": "Flamingo is designed to process sequences where visual and textual data are interleaved arbitrarily. This capability allows it to understand and generate responses based on complex multimodal inputs, making it versatile for tasks like visual question answering and captioning.",
