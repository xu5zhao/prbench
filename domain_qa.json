        "answer": "DETR can be extended to panoptic segmentation by adding a mask head on top of the decoder outputs. This mask head can predict binary masks for each predicted object and treat both 'things' and 'stuff' classes in a unified approach. The attention-based architecture of DETR allows it to produce non-overlapping masks directly, bypassing the need for heuristic post-processing steps, and leveraging the encoder's global reasoning capabilities to enhance segmentation quality, especially in 'stuff' classes."

        "question": "How does the Informer model manage to theoretically lower the time complexity and memory usage compared to traditional Transformer models for long sequence time-series forecasting?",
        "answer": "Informer achieves lower time complexity and memory usage through its ProbSparse self-attention mechanism that reduces computation by focusing on top-u queries, which are determined by sparsity measurements. This adjustment allows Informer to change the complexity from O(L^2) to O(L log L). The generative style decoder and self-attention distilling further contribute to efficiency, by simplifying the decoding process and reducing memory usage, respectively."

        "answer": "SegFormer’s use of non-local attention and hierarchical encoding enlarges the effective receptive field compared to CNN models, which are often limited.

        "answer": "Representation collapse refers to the phenomenon where the encoder networks in Siamese architectures produce nearly constant embeddings for all inputs, which limits the capability of the network to learn meaningful representations.

        "answer": "Transformers naturally have less inductive bias compared to convolutional neural networks. Convolutional layers in CNNs have inherent spatial properties that aid in analyzing images, thereby reducing their reliance on large amounts of varied data.

        "answer": "Convnets provide strong inductive biases due to their architectural design which is explicitly tailored to understanding visual data.

Additionally, the hierarchical feature learning in convnets might help transformers learn better feature mappings during distillation than another transformer, which does not have such inductive biases."

        "question": "How does the positional embedding adaptation occur when varying the image resolution during transformer fine-tuning, and why is this necessary?",
        "answer": "When varying image resolution, positional embeddings need interpolation because they are tied to specific patch numbers. Changing the resolution alters the number of patches, thus requiring a recalibration of these embeddings to maintain spatial coherence. Properly adjusting positional embeddings ensures the transformer can integrate spatial information correctly even when the input size changes, which is essential for consistent performance across different resolutions."

        "answer": "For standard transformers, performance tends to saturate with extended training schedules, indicating limited gains after reaching a training stage. However, for distilled transformers, longer training schedules result in improved performance. This is because the distillation process uses enhanced supervision from the teacher model, resulting in constant learning improvements and effectively exploiting longer training times, unlike the vanilla models."

As more languages are added, this capacity is spread thinner across languages, potentially reducing the model's ability to capture complex structures and nuances, particularly for lower-resource languages with less data."

        "question": "What role does the sampling rate control parameter alpha (α) play in the training of XLM-R, and why is an α value of 0.3 chosen?",
        "answer": "The sampling rate control parameter alpha (α) influences the frequency and proportion of training examples from different languages seen by the model. It helps balance training by ensuring both high-resource and low-resource languages are effectively sampled. An α value of 0.3 is chosen as it provides an optimal balance in performance, allowing the model to achieve better per-language representation without overly favoring high-resource language examples."
